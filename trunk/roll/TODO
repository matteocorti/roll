Minor
=====

* Add doxygen comments.

* Memory allocation: at the moment if 'h' or 'l' are specified all the results are kept sorted and only the relevant are considered.
  If the number of dices is high to spare some memory one could allocate only h or l elements and for every result scan all the previous results
  Complexity?

Major
=====

* Implement macros (e.g., in a preference file .rollrc) to define
  common rolls
  
  mace = 1D8+3 
  $ roll mace
  $ roll mace + 5
  
  stat = 3D6
  $ roll stat
