.SH NAME
@PACKAGE_NAME@ \- rolls a user-defined dice sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "@PACKAGE_NAME@ " "[" "-vh"  "] [" "--version" "] expression"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
Rolls a user-defined dice sequence. The dices to roll are defined
using dN where N is the number of sides. Dices can be rolled multiple
times by prepending the number of repetitions (e.g., 3d6) and used in
simple mathematical expressions (e.g., 2d8+4).

.SH EXPRESSIONS
Expressions are in dice notation (also known as dice algebra, common dice notation or RPG dice notation)

Die rolls are expressed in the form NdX or NDX where N is the number of dices
(1 if omitted) and X the number of dice faces.

If the final number is omitted, it is assumed to be a six.

To this basic notation, an additive modifier can be appended, yielding
expressions of the form, NdX+C. The plus can be replaced by a minus
sign ("-") for subtraction. C is a number to be subtracted from the
final total.
