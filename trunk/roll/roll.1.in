.SH NAME
@PACKAGE_NAME@ \- rolls a user-defined dice sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "@PACKAGE_NAME@ " "[" "-vhp"  "] [" "--version" "] expression"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
Rolls a user-defined dice sequence. The dices to roll are defined
using dN where N is the number of sides. Dices can be rolled multiple
times by prepending the number of repetitions (e.g., 3d6) and used in
simple mathematical expressions (e.g., 2d8+4).

.SH EXPRESSIONS
Expressions are in dice notation (also known as dice algebra, common
dice notation or RPG dice notation).

Die rolls are expressed in the form NdX or NDX where N is the number of dices
(1 if omitted) and X the number of dice faces.

If the final number is omitted, it is assumed to be a six.

To this basic notation, an additive modifier can be appended, yielding
expressions of the form, NdX+C. The plus can be replaced by a minus
sign ("-") for subtraction. C is a number to be added subtracted from
the final total.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation

.SH Percentile dice (d%)

Often, the variable X in the above notation will be "%". Although a
100-sided die does exist, it is both more common and more uniformly
random to use a combination of two ten-sided dice known as percentile
dice, where one die represents tens and the other units.  A roll of
two zeroes means 100.

If you want to roll a single 100-sided die use the "d100" notation.

.SH Fudge dice (dF or df)

The Fudge role-playing game system uses customized "Fudge dice" which
have an equal number of plus, minus and blank sides.

.SH Multipliers

In some games, the above notation is expanded to allow for a
multiplier, as in NdXxC or CxNdX, where "x" or "*" denotes
multiplication (can be replaced by "/" for division) and C is a
natural number.

Results are rounded up.

.SH Reroll filters

It is possible to specify restrictions on dice rolls telling which
values to keep and which values to discard by putting a filter after
the dice. If a value is to be discarded the dice is re-rolled until
the result is valid value. You can specify to keep only values bigger
(>), bigger or equal (>=), smaller (<), smaller or equal (<=) or
different (!=) from a given number. The comparator is specified right
after the the die specification (e.g., 1D6>2).

.SH Selective results

It is possible to keep only the M highest or lowest dices with the following notation:

.PD 0
.TP
NdXhM: roll N dices with X sides and keep the highest M results (M must be less or equal N)
.TP
NdXlM: roll N dices with X sides and keep the lowest M results (M must be less or equal N)
.PD 1

.SH Series and repetitions

It is possible to concatenate top-level expressions with a comma
("expression, expression") and to repeat the execution of an
expression or a set of expressions by using a counter and curly
brackets ("N{ expression}")

.SH Examples

.PD 0
.TP
3d6        rolls 3 6-sided dices and sums the results
    (can be abbreviated with "3d")
.TP
1d8 + 3    rolls 1 8-sided die and adds 3
    (can be abbreviated by "d8+3")
.TP
d%         rolls 2 10-sided dices: one represents the tens and
    the other units
.TP
1d6x5      rolls 1 6-sided dice and multiplies the result by 5
.TP
1d6 / 2    rolls 1 6-sided dice and divides the result by 2 (1d3)
.TP
4d6h3      rolls 4 6-sided dices and keeps the 3 highest results
    (discarding the lowest)
.TP
6{3d6}     rolls 3d6 6 times
.TP
"1d6>2"    rolls 1d6 until the result is bigger than 2 (expression is quoted to avoid the > being interpreted as redirection by the shell)
.TP
4DF        rolls 4 Fudge dices
