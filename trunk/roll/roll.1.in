.SH NAME
@PACKAGE_NAME@ \- rolls a user-defined dice sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "@PACKAGE_NAME@ " "[" "-vh"  "] [" "--version" "] expression"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
Rolls a user-defined dice sequence. The dices to roll are defined
using dN where N is the number of sides. Dices can be rolled multiple
times by prepending the number of repetitions (e.g., 3d6) and used in
simple mathematical expressions (e.g., 2d8+4).

.SH EXPRESSIONS
Expressions are in dice notation (also known as dice algebra, common dice notation or RPG dice notation)

Die rolls are expressed in the form NdX or NDX where N is the number of dices
(1 if omitted) and X the number of dice faces.

If the final number is omitted, it is assumed to be a six.

To this basic notation, an additive modifier can be appended, yielding
expressions of the form, NdX+C. The plus can be replaced by a minus
sign ("-") for subtraction. C is a number to be subtracted from the
final total.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation

.SH Percentile dice (d%)

Often, the variable X in the above notation will be "%". Although a
100-sided die does exist, it is both more common and more uniformly
random to use a combination of two ten-sided dice known as percentile
dice, where one die represents tens and the other units.  A roll of
two zeroes means 100.

If you want to roll a single 100-sided die use the "d100" notation.

.SH Multipliers

In some games, the above notation is expanded to allow for a
multiplier, as in NdXxC or CxNdX, where "x" or "*" denotes
multiplication (can be replaced by "/" for division) and C is a
natural number.

Results are rounded up.

.SH Selective results

It is possible to keep only the M highest or lowest dices with the following notation:


.PD 0
.TP
NdXhM: roll N dices with X sides and keep the highest M results (M must be less or equal N)
.TP
NdXlM: roll N dices with X sides and keep the lowest M results (M must be less or equal N)

.SH Examples

.PD 0
.TP
3d6        rolls 3 6-sided dices and sums the results
    (can be abbreviated with "3d")
.TP
1d8 + 3    rolls 1 8-sided die and adds 3
    (can be abbreviated by "d8+3")
.TP
d%         rolls 2 10-sided dices: one represents the tens and
    the other units
.TP
1d6x5      rolls 1 6-sided dice and multiplies the result by 5
.TP
1d6 / 2    rolls 1 6-sided dice and divides the result by 2 (1d3)
.TP
4d6h3      rolls 4 6-sided dices and keeps the 3 highest results
    (discarding the lowest)

.TP
factor     := number dice [ ("h"|"H"|"l"|"L") number ] | dice .
.TP
dice       := "d" | "D" [ number | "%" ] .
